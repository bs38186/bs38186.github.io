Hey there! My name is Sifat and this summer I hope to travel to Bali. Bali is an island in Indonesia. Bali is known for it's volcanic mountains
and iconic rice paddies. In the midst of a majority muslim country Bali in the only majority Hindu state or island with it's unique cultural values.

 In the short term, this program will give me the opportunity to receive two three hour anthropology courses while not sitting in a classroom. 
 Having the opportunity to discuss and study the culture of a region while being engaged in the midst of it all is a reward in itself. 
 Additionally, I hope to learn and engage in the Balinese culture through first hand experiences by meeting locals in a much more intimate manner. 
 This will allow me to engage with the culture and the people more thoroughly than any tv show. 
 As an Environmental Engineering major the program, especially interests me as I would like to observe the environmental effects of Baliâ€™s rapidly <br>growing tourism industry.
 But most of all, this program will allow me to pursue my passion of traveling and exploring especially through food. Food can say a lot about a culture's past, 
 present and future.Indonesia is known for their elaborate food culture; the privilege to explore their culture through food would be a dream come true.
 I believe experiences like these will help me become a more knowledgeable and wholesome human being in the long term.
